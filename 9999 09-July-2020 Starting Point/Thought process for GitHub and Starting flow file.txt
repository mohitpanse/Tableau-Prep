Thought Process behind this flow:

I started practising Tableau Prep last year in 2019 but couldn't continue due to some reasons.

Today on 9-July-2020, I decided to start it again from the scratch; for which I had to create a folder to store each week's files:
	* Input (excel or csv)
	* Output (excel or csv or .tde)
	* Flow file (.tfl)
	* Screenshot of the flow

Also, I decided to keep backup of my work via GitHub repository (I saw many people doing this for Prep)!

There is a catch that GitHub does not create/replicate the blank folders. As a solution I had to create Step #8 in Tablea Prep flow. 

The best way to create multiple folders at a time is the CMD option (yeah, the old school one)! The challenge was I needed the folder name in following format:

FORMAT --> YYYY Week XX- Topic of the week - where YYYY stands for year and XX for week number.

The webpage https://preppindata.blogspot.com/p/the-challenge-index.html has listed all the challenges and their solutions till date. I copied the whole text in an excel (Raw File), added 2019 and 2020 as the year column and the rest of the cleaning was done in Tableau Prep.

Now the steps executed in Prep :)

1. Enabled data interpretor option in Prep

2. Changed Year data type to String

3. Excluded Year = NULL

4. Excluded Challenge = NULL

5. New field 'Challenge_' to remove the 'Challenge','Solution',' ' and '?' from the Challenge column

	REPLACE(
		REPLACE(
			REPLACE(
				REPLACE(
					REPLACE([Challenge],"Challenge","")
    				,"Solution","")
				,"  ","")
    		,":","-")
    	,"?","")

6. New field 'New Challenge' to get the value in the desired FORMAT which was mentioned above.

	[Year] + " " +

	if FINDNTH([Challenge_],"-",1) = 7 THEN

		REPLACE([Challenge_],MID([Challenge_],6,1),"0"+MID([Challenge_],6,1))
    
	ELSE

		[Challenge_]

	END

7. New field 'Make Directory' to create directories via CMD option
	
	"md" + ' "' + [New Challenge] + '" '


8. New field 'Create New File' to copy README.md file from the root directory to each folder to be created with the help of 'Make Directory' values

	"copy README.md " + ' "' + [New Challenge] + '" '

9. Removed the following fields:
	* Challenge_
	* Year
	* Challenge

10. Ran the flow and created the csv file 'Clean Output'

11. Created the folder by copying all values from 'Make Directory' column and pasting it in CMD console.

12. Copied the README.md by copying all values from 'Create New File' column and pasting it in CMD console.

As the folders were created successfully and they all had at least 1 file inside them, I was able to commit my changes to GitHub repository :)
