# Tableau-Prep

This project has all the solutions for weekly Tableau prep challenges from https://preppindata.blogspot.com/.

The first challenge was published on February 13, 2019 as Week 1.


What does the Tableau Prep Builder workspace consists of?
(A) Connections pane: where you connect to your data sources, and three coordinated areas that help you interact with and explore your data.

(B) Flow pane: A visual representation of your operation steps as you prepare your data. This is where you add steps to build your flow.

(C) Profile pane: A summary of each field in your data sample. See the shape of your data and quickly find outliers and null values.

(D) Data grid: The row level detail for your data.
